# Mendelian-Inheritance
Mendelian Inheritance interactive learning 


Objective

Bring Mendelâ€™s pea plant experiments, demonstrating inheritance, to life by converting design
mockups into a usable interactive. In this simple interactive, learners should be able to
experiment with the breeding (crossing) of pea plants and see a visualization of their choices.


Project requirements:
1. Develop an interactive which users cross 2 pea plants, each with one of the following
genotypes: YY; yy; Yy
2. Display the results of the breeding as a Punnett square
3. Include data visualizations of the Punnett square cross proportions
a. Phenotypic Ratio and Genotypic Ratio
4. When different genotypes are selected the visualizations should be updated
5. The interactive should be responsive (mobile and desktop)
6. Do not include Harvard logos or institution names within your demo or repository
7. Project should run on localhost, ideally host your project
8. Consider ui elements (hover and active states, inputs, usability, accessibility,
responsiveness)
9. Do not minify or compress your code

10. Use version control, and be able to provide the url to your project repo
a. Include a README.md file
i. Explain your design decisions
ii. Explain your development decisions
iii. Explain areas for future improvement
iv. Add anything else you think is important
