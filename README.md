# Mendelian-Inheritance
Mendelian Inheritance interactive learning 


Objective

Bring Mendel’s pea plant experiments, demonstrating inheritance, to life by converting design
mockups into a usable interactive. In this simple interactive, learners should be able to
experiment with the breeding (crossing) of pea plants and see a visualization of their choices.


Project requirements:
1. Develop an interactive which users cross 2 pea plants, each with one of the following
genotypes: YY; yy; Yy
2. Display the results of the breeding as a Punnett square
3. Include data visualizations of the Punnett square cross proportions
a. Phenotypic Ratio and Genotypic Ratio
4. When different genotypes are selected the visualizations should be updated
5. The interactive should be responsive (mobile and desktop)
6. Do not include Harvard logos or institution names within your demo or repository
7. Project should run on localhost, ideally host your project
8. Consider ui elements (hover and active states, inputs, usability, accessibility,
responsiveness)

10. Use version control, and be able to provide the url to your project repo

i. Explain your design decisions

- reading about Bring Mendel’s pea plant experiments
- understand the experiments
- imagine how student will interactive with it.
- end user interactive without too much effort
	
ii. Explain your development decisions

- create layout base on the design
- interactive base on user input, select 2 peas build image table
- need connect the data and image, add mouse over table change background color function
- testing in IE, FF, Chrome, 
	

iii. Explain areas for future improvement
- website 508 compliance checker
- QA on more browser and devices


iv. Add anything else you think is important
